# Tube2SQL
This tool enables you to input a YouTube user or channel name, and will output a filled out relational database containing the user's or channel's activities. This can be used to visualize activity relationships between users or channels, perform Social Network Analysis of selected targets, or cross-reference activity habits between users and/or channels. Additionally, the project will contain functionality to analyze the unformatted output for a user's own viewing history as available from takeout.google.com, which provides every YouTube account holder with access to all stored data about their account activities that Google stores.
